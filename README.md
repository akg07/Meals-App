<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

#### Live link for website
https://meal-app-akg.netlify.app/

#### Features
1. ##### Home Page
    * Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
    
    * Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).
    
    * On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page

2. ##### Meal Detail Page
    * Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

3. ##### My favourite meals Page
    * Display a list of all the favourite meals.
    * Make this list persistent (should have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
    * Remove from favourites button: Each meal should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.
